<h2> Game Idea</h2>

<p>
  The Jam theme was "Make Me Laugh". After reflecting on the theme and the orgainzation video for a while, I've remembered of a story of a famous court jester, Triboulet. Triboulet was a famous court jester in France back in the XV Century. His most famous story tells that one day, he slapped the kings butt as a joke. The king wasn't happy with the joke, and sentenced him to death. However, he decided to give him a chance, as his apologies must be more offensive than the previous joke. He quicly responded "Sorry your majesty, I've mistaken you for the Queen". The Queen was out of bounds, due to his response, Triboulet was again facing a death penalty. As a merciful act, due to his years of service, the King gave Triboulet the power to choose how he wanted to die. The Jester then responded "Well your Majesy, for the sake of Saint Nitouche and Saint Pansard, patrons of insanity, I choose to die of old age". The King laughed and found the response quite funny, he then decided to just ban him from the court rather than kill him.

  Inspired by Triboulet story, I thougth about a game where a court jester must make the king laugh to avoid being killed. The Jester will have some utensils, such as, juggling balls, bombs and banana peels. He can try to defeat the king by throwing things at him, however, the best way to do it its to make him laugh, once he reaches a certain level of fun, he will receive more damage and will be easier to defeat.
